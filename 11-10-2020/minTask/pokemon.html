                        in Japan in 1996, and
                        features several
                        species of creatures called "Pokémon" that players, called "trainers", are encouraged to
                        capture, train, and use to
                        battle other players' Pokémon or interact with the game's world.[3] Pikachu was one of several
                        different Pokémon designs
                        conceived by Game Freak's character development team. Artist Atsuko Nishida is credited as the
                        main person behind
                        Pikachu's design, which was later finalized by artist Ken Sugimori. According to series producer
                        Satoshi
                        Tajiri, the name is derived from a combination of two Japanese sounds: pika, a sound an electric
                        spark makes, and chu, a
                        sound a mouse makes.Despite its name's origins, however, Nishida based Pikachu's generation 1
                        design, especially its
                        cheeks, on squirrels. Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as one of the most difficult
                        to create, due to an
                        effort to make it appealing</p>
